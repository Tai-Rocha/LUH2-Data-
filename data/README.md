Most data (rasters or NetCDF files) are too large to put here. Besides, GitHub is proper to store and version control codes, and not to store large data files. However, for reproducibility purposes, I created here the same directories structure used in the project. Each directory contains a README with instructions about which files you should put in the folder. Also, I put the links to obtained data.

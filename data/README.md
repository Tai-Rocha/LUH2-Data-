Most data (rasters or netcdf files) are too large to put here. Besides GitHub is proper to store and version control codes, and not to store large data files. However for reproducibility purposes, I created here the same directories structure used in the project.

**RAW** directory contains two subdirectories : <br />

FAO: contains GLS-SHARE RAW file in zip file<br />

LUH2_netcdf : contains raw netcdf files from [Land Use Harmonization Project](https://luh.umd.edu/data.shtml)

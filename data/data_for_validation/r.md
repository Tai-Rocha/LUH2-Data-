Most data (rasters or netcdf files) are too large to put here. Besides GitHub is proper to store and version control codes, and not to store large data files. However for reproducibility purposes. I created here the same directories structure used in the project.

The data directory has 3 main subdirectories as follow:<br />
data_for_validation contains 4 layers: <br />
1- glc_shv10_DOM.Tif (Land-use Land-cover of GLS_SHARE) <br />
2- LULC_year_2000_CMPI_accucary_input.tif (Land-use Land cover of LUH2)<br />
3- FAO_reclassified.tif<br />
4- LULC_2000_CMIP6_reclass.tif<br />
